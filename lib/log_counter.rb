This directory contains marker files indicating which source log files have
been processed.  Each file has a name corresponding to a log file which was
present in the source log directory.  The file contains the size of the log
file at the time it was processed, as a decimal string.  Logs will be
re-processed if their sizes do not match the stored value.

To trigger re-processing of a particular log file, remove the corresponding
file from this directory.
